    Card.create!(name: "0 - The Fool", description: "As The Fool is numbered zero, he represents a blank slate, and new beginnings. He is innocent, with much to learn. If you draw the Fool upright, it can signify that you are about to start a new journey or new phase. It is a sign to have courage and take risks. Expect the unexpected, and go for your dreams.", reverse_description: "If you draw the Fool in reverse, it could be a sign to be cautious. Your innocence may cause you to literally act like a fool by looking before you leap and potentially allowing yourself to be taken advantage of. You may be living in the moment and not worrying too much about the future consequences. If so, take this as a warning to slow down and consider your actions.", attached_image: "fool.png")
    Card.create!(name: "I - The Magician", description: "The upright Magician symbolises new beginnings, and signifies that you have the strength, skills, and determination to make something great out of a new era of your life. You have the ability to manifest the powers of the universe and make them work in your favour. Maybe you’re starting a new job, embarking on a creative project, or entering a new romantic relationship. Whatever it is, don’t hesitate. You have the power to make it a success.", reverse_description: "The reversed Magician unfortunately represents deception and trickery. It is a warning to be careful of who you trust. There may be somebody in your life who pretends to have your best interests at heart, when really they are manipulating you to their own gain. It may also suggest that you have skills and knowledge that are not being used to their full potential, which is frustrating you and causing you to make hasty decisions. Take a step back and think carefully about what you are doing, and how you can make positive changes.", attached_image: "magician.png")
    Card.create!(name: "II - The High Priestess", description: "The High Priestess represents inner knowledge and wisdom. If you encounter her upright, it is a sign to trust your instincts. She symbolises a strong, powerful woman. This could be somebody in your life who is there to offer you advice or support in reaching your potential. The card also shows spiritual knowledge and a link to the subconscious; you should pay attention to your dreams and your intuition. Practice meditation and focus on what you want to achieve. Trust your gut and don’t let outside influences affect your decision-making.", reverse_description: "In reverse, the High Priestess suggests that you are not listening to your instincts and are allowing other factors to influence your decisions. Take some Time to Reflect about what you really want, and what feels right to you. You may be suppressing feelings and allowing others to weigh in and overrule your instincts with their opinions. It’s time to stop asking others for advice as this is likely confusing and conflicting, and instead turn inwards. Trust yourself and your intuition.", attached_image: "high_priestess.png")
    Card.create!(name: "III - The Empress", description: "The Empress is a sign to connect with your feminine energy. It calls for you to be creative, and bring beauty into your life. Treat yourself to a day of pampering, or get in touch with your creative side by spending time on hobbies such as music, art, or drama. The Empress also represents fertility, and could signify a pregnancy or a birth. Whether this is a literal or metaphorical birth depends on the other cards in the spread, so study them closely. If not a physical birth, it could symbolise a ‘rebirth’ and new cycle in your life.", reverse_description: "The Empress in reverse symbolises that you have lost your personal power and that you need to take it back. Perhaps you’ve focused too much on looking after other people, and have neglected yourself. You may be struggling to find harmony, and finding it difficult to communicate successfully in relationships. You must take some time for yourself to recharge and take back your strength and power. You may be taking your role as caregiver or adviser too far, and are at risk of smothering those you are trying to help. Step back, give you and them some space, and things will be more easy and harmonious again.", attached_image: "empress.png")
    Card.create!(name: "IV - The Emperor", description: "The Emperor represents authority and control. He is a symbol of masculinity and could symbolise an actual male figure in your life who you can go to for help. Or, it could symbolise your desire to be somebody with his status and authority. You are ambitious and determined to succeed. If you are facing a difficult challenge, you need to have confidence and focus, and you will push through and come out on top. You have the ability to achieve your goals if you put your mind to it.", reverse_description: "Reversed, this card suggests that there is an abuse of power or authority in your life at this time. This could be from somebody like a parent, boss, or partner. You may feel powerless and like things in your life are out of your control. Perhaps you are dealing with a difficult situation with a governing body or people in authority. This reversed card suggests that you should stand up to the person with the power and challenge them. On a personal level, this card in reverse represents your own lack of confidence and self-control, and these are things you need to work on so that you can take back the power and control in your life.", attached_image: "emperor.png")
    Card.create!(name: "V - The Hierophant", description: "The Hierophant is a very traditional and conventional, and symbolises a clear set of rules to be followed. If you draw this card, it is a sign that you should simply do what you need to, which should be obvious to you. This is not a time to rebel or take an unusual approach to a situation, but to follow due process and stick to the status quo. The Hierophant may appear in your life as a wise, steady advisor who will help you on your path and guide you to success. This could be a teacher or a counsellor. It is important to listen to this person’s advice.", reverse_description: "If you draw the Hierophant in reverse, it could suggest that you are feeling frustrated and restricted in a strict, possibly controlling environment. You may be tempted to rebel and break the rules, especially if the situation you are in goes against your beliefs or morals. It may indicate a spot of trouble with authorities, such as a teacher or a boss. Tread carefully; though going against the grain could be the right decision, you need to ensure you go about it the right way.", attached_image: "hierophant.png")
    Card.create!(name: "VI - The Lovers", description: "If you draw the Lovers, it could signify the beginning of a new relationship. This relationship doesn’t necessarily need to be romantic; it could be a new friendship, or a business partnership. If the relationship is romantic though, this card is a positive sign; it symbolises a deep connection, both physically and mentally. The sexual attraction too goes beyond lust, and there is most likely a deep intimacy. Another meaning of the Lovers card is choice; it symbolises that you are at a crossroads, and you have an important decision to make. As a Major Arcana card, the Lovers suggests this decision is potentially life-changing. It’s important to think carefully before you take your next steps. Make sure your decision is right for you in the long run, and you’re not just taking the easy path.", reverse_description: "In reverse, the Lovers isn’t a happy card. If referring to a relationship, it symbolises instability and a possible fallout. There may be a separation, and possibly heartache. You may have recently ended a love affair, or are currently considering it. On a personal level, it indicates that you have some internal conflict, and are perhaps at war with yourself over a painful decision you know you must make. You may be struggling and avoiding making a tough choice, but stalling will only cause more strife in the long run.", attached_image: "lovers.png")
    Card.create!(name: "VII - The Chariot", description: "When you draw The Chariot in a Tarot reading, it symbolises your strength and willpower. You have created your goals and set forth your intentions, and you are now well on your way to achieving your dreams. You are a very determined and disciplined person who will work hard to achieve whatever they set their mind to. There will be challenges and tests along the way, but don’t worry; you are well equipped with the skills and tools to face and conquer those obstacles in your path. Sometimes, this card is a literal representation of a trip or journey that you will soon embark on.", reverse_description: "Upright, the Chariot is all go, go, go. However in reverse, this card is a sign that you are currently stuck and are unable to move forward. You may be feeling unmotivated to work on a project, or perhaps you’re desperate to work but there is something stopping you, such as not having the right resources or simply having too many other things to do. If something is stopping you, it’s time to take a look at the situation from a different angle and figure out if you can take a new approach. You may be fighting for control as you feel like somebody else isn’t doing as good a job as you could. Decide whether you can work together rather than struggling to take over.", attached_image: "chariot.png")
    Card.create!(name: "VIII - Strength", description: "Similar to the Chariot, the Strength card represents fierce willpower and determination. The clue is in the name; you are in a place in your life when you are feeling powerful and able to face any challenges and overcome any obstacles in your path. There is a gentleness to your strength and you do not charge forward and get ahead by knocking down others; instead, you are subtle and controlled, and others can often be surprised because they have underestimated your power. You are very self-confident and you are able to trust your raw, gut instincts because you know that they are usually right. You are on a sure road to success.", reverse_description: "In reverse, the Strength card indicates that you are not currently feeling like your true self. You have lost touch with your inner power and strength and are not feeling particularly sure of yourself or your abilities. You may have recently been dealt a blow or had a setback that has knocked your confidence, and you are unsure about how to get back on your feet and recover from it.", attached_image: "strength.png")
    Card.create!(name: "IX - The Hermit", description: "Drawing the Hermit suggests that you are currently taking some time out of your busy schedule, or you definitely need to soon. Now is a time for practicing some self-care and give your mind, body, and spirit time to rest and recuperate. The outside world is noisy with the opinions of others and at this time, you simply need quiet so that you can look within and reflect on your deepest hopes and dreams. You possibly have a big decision to make and to do this you need to allow yourself to consider all of the information and the consequences of the different choices you could make, and what these would mean for your life.", reverse_description: "In reverse, the Hermit has two different meanings, and it depends on the other cards in the deck which one is relevant to you. The first is that you are in dire need of some alone time. You are caught up in the noise of the world around you and are busy with endless responsibilities of daily life and these things are keeping you from time to simply sit down and think. You need to find some time to shut yourself off and simply enjoy reflecting on yourself and your life. On the flipside, this may be a warning that you are spending too much time alone and are at risk of cutting yourself off from your loved ones if you carry on. Too much reflection and not enough action is not good. It’s time to get back out there and put all of those ideas and plans to good use.", attached_image: "hermit.png")
    Card.create!(name: "X - Wheel of Fortune", description: "The Wheel of Fortune is a symbol of the Wheel of Life, a reminder that life keeps going and the cycle is always turning and changing. If you are going through a hard time right now, have hope that the wheel will turn and soon enough your luck will return. Similarly, it’s important when things are going well that things can change, so always remember to prepare for rainy days. This card is also about Karma, and reminds you that what goes around, comes back around. Treat others how you wish to be treated. If you put good out into the world, you should receive good fortune in return. Sometimes this card is a reminder to let go of trying to control everything in your life and trust in the universe.", reverse_description: "If you draw the Wheel of Fortune in reverse, it could mean that a streak of good luck you’ve been having is unfortunately about to end, and you are going to face some difficult challenges. You may feel like some things are slipping further out of your control. Though it’s tempting to grasp on as tightly as possible, sometimes it’s best to simply trust that the universe will make things right in time. On the flipside, you may just be coming out of a bad period of your life, and this card is a sign that things are about to get much better.", attached_image: "wheel_of_fortune.png")
    Card.create!(name: "XI - Justice", description: "As the name suggests, drawing Justice in a reading suggests that recent actions are going to be judged and that you or somebody in your life will deal with the consequences. If you know that your recent actions have been pure of heart and morally sound, then you obviously have nothing to worry about. However, if you have recently done something that you know is wrong and have tried to hide it, this is a warning that the truth will soon come out and you will need to face up to your actions. However, Justice is always fair and usually understanding and compassionate. If you are seeking justice for something that has been done against you, this is a good sign that you will soon get it. This is a common card if you are currently involved in legal proceedings.", reverse_description: "In reverse, Justice is a sign that you are struggling with an internal conflict; you are aware that recent actions have not been completely honourable and are trying to decide whether to admit your mistakes or keep quiet. If you tell the truth, you will be at the mercy of others and will need to ask for their fair judgement and forgiveness. Though this may seem risky, keeping quiet means that you carry the burden around with you on your conscience. Alternatively, the truth may have already come out and you are refusing to take responsibility. You are lying to yourself as well as others, and this is not bound to end well. Owning up and taking responsibility is your best course of action here.", attached_image: "justice.png")
    Card.create!(name: "XII - The Hanged Man", description: "The Hanged Man is a card that represents taking a break and possible delays. Sometimes it’s necessary to pause and rest for a while in order to reflect and connect with your inner self and the spiritual world. Often, we know ourselves and when we need to step back and take a break, but sometimes we ignore this urge and carry on. In this case, the universe will often take over and force us to pause. You may be experiencing delays in a project that are causing some frustration because you are keen to move forward but are incapable of doing so. Take this as A Good Thing, and use this time to look at things from a different perspective. Personally, now is a good time to have some space and practice some self-care and reflection.", reverse_description: "In reverse, the Hanged Man suggests that you are avoiding your inner thoughts and feelings by keeping busy and distracted. There may be a trauma or other issue that is causing you pain but you simply don’t want to deal with, so are simply ignoring it instead. This is not bound to end well and this card is a message to hit pause and take some time to allow yourself to breathe and feel. Burying issues in the sand never works because they will eventually resurface bigger and harder to deal with later. Alternatively, you may have been feeling stuck for a while now, with projects on hold and things not going to plan. In this case, this card is often a sign that things are about to start moving again, so prepare yourself to get back into the swing of things once more.", attached_image: "hanged_man.png")
    Card.create!(name: "XIII - Death", description: "People often panic when they draw Death in a reading, which is understandable. However, this card is extremely misconstrued, and in fact this card is one of the most positive cards in the deck. This card is all about endings and transformations. If you draw this card, it is a message that a major phase of your life is ending, and a new one is beginning. Though change can be hard sometimes and it is sad to let go of the past, the future is full of potential and what is coming is even better than what was before. This change may be sudden and unexpected, just as death is sometimes, and it may take some getting used to. But you will recover and you will move on and you will be happier than ever.", reverse_description: "Upright, Death is a card of change and transformation. In reverse, this card suggests that you are resisting that change and are unwilling to let go of the past and move on. You may be scared of letting go because you don’t know what to expect, but holding on will only do you harm in the long run. Death is a message to trust the universe and let go, embrace the change and see what happens. You will be pleasantly surprised by what happens to you and your life when you allow yourself to move on.", attached_image: "death.png")
    Card.create!(name: "XIV - Temperance", description: "Similar to Justice, Temperance is a card of balance, fairness, and patience. If you draw this card, it is a message that you need to bring your life into balance as it is currently a little off-center. You are very busy and possibly stressed, and you find it hard in your bustling schedule to take time to yourself. Staying calm when things are rough is essential, so practice patience and give yourself time to pause and reflect when you can. If making a decision or judgement, you must stay unbiased and review all of the information, and make a decision that is based on logic and reasoning rather than emotion. Try to make sure that you are balancing your priorities equally, and that you are not neglecting important aspects of your life in favour of others.", reverse_description: "In reverse, Temperance is a message that you are currently dealing with some sort of excessive situation. Perhaps you have been eating and drinking a lot, spending too much money, or partying with friends more than usual. Though it’s good to let loose sometimes and indulge ourselves, too much of one thing can lead to problems later. This card is a sign that it’s about time to cut back and take a little more control. You may be feeling unbalanced and like something in your life is not quite right. It’s time to get back to your true self and practice some self-control and balance. Take some Time to Reflect on yourself and what you are doing, and what changes you can make in order to feel more settled and calm.", attached_image: "temperance.png")
    Card.create!(name: "XV - The Devil", description: "The Devil represents the darker side of your personality and your desires. If you draw this card, it is a sign that you are not living your best life. You are likely struggling with some bad habits or behaviours and though you know that you are doing things you shouldn’t, you are finding it difficult to stop. The Devil is a great temptress and it’s hard to say no. The Devil may be representing a real person in your life who is leading you astray. This card is a warning that you need to learn to say no to them before they lead you so far that you may not be able to find your way back.", reverse_description: "The Devil in reverse often suggests that you are aware that your past behaviours or habits have not been great, but you’re looking to change. You may be finding it difficult to break free of old temptations or the people who lead you to them, but you have to believe in yourself and your strength. You can do anything you set your mind to, and you can overcome these obstacles in your path to a healthier, happier life. Sometimes this card is a sign that you have hit rock bottom. Though that’s not a pleasant thought, the good thing is that from here, the only way is up.", attached_image: "devil.png")
    Card.create!(name: "XVI - The Tower", description: "Drawing The Tower in a reading tells you that you are currently facing or are about to face a period of great change and upheaval. This change will likely come suddenly and unexpectedly and may be quite painful. Usually, these changes come in the form of a breakup, a death, health problems, or loss of a job. This change will hit you hard and you may feel like your world is crashing down around your ears. Though this is obviously not a pleasant experience, it will be one that will teach you a lot about yourself and your life. These events will open your eyes and cause you to completely reevaluate where you are and what you want to do. Eventually, you will be stronger and wiser thanks to this period of painful growth.", reverse_description: "In reverse, the Tower still represents a big change in your life, but this time it is you that has decided to make this change, not the universe. Your eyes have been opened to the truth and you are bringing into question everything in your life and whether it is good for you. You are having a spiritual awakening and are deeply connected to your innermost self and desires. You are excited to make big changes in your life, and you have no qualms about cutting out those things or people who do not bring value to you.", attached_image: "tower.png")
    Card.create!(name: "XVII - The Star", description: "The Star is a highly inspirational card, following the pain and destruction of the Tower and bringing hope and relief with it. You have recently been through some trials and tribulations and may still be reeling from the effects of these challenges. The Star is a source of inspiration, and is a sign that you are now moving to a much easier phase of your life. You have the feeling that anything is possible and are full of ideas that you are keen to put into action. You are about to begin a spiritual journey that will teach you more about yourself and your desires. Go where this energy guides you and you won’t be disappointed.", reverse_description: "The upright Star is a card of inspiration. However, in reverse, it is a sign that you are feeling stuck and uninspired. Life is full of challenges and you may have been going through a tough time that you are finding hard to put behind you and move on from. This card is a test of your strength and your faith; both in yourself and in the universe. If you draw this card in reverse, take some time out just for yourself, and practice some self-care. Giving yourself time to relax and heal will allow you to move on stronger than ever when you are ready.", attached_image: "star.png")
    Card.create!(name: "XVIII - The Moon", description: "The Moon represents our innermost thoughts, feelings, dreams, and fears. Drawing this card suggests that you are projecting your inner fears onto your present and future life, and this is preventing you from living your life to the full. This card also suggests that you are trying to bury Painful Memories or experiences and not deal with them. However, the longer you suppress pain, the worse it eventually is when it inevitably resurfaces. You may be struggling to make a decision because you feel like you don’t have all the facts. If this is true, trust your intuition and you won’t go wrong.", reverse_description: "In reverse, the Moon suggests that you are coming to the end of a period of fear and anxiety, and are heading into calmer waters. Your vision is clearing and you are able to see things more positively and work through your fears to move forward in a positive direction. You are likely feeling a stronger connection to your intuition and the spiritual world. It’s a good idea to strengthen these links through meditation. Pay close attention to your dreams as these are strong messages from your subconscious, and may be telling you what it is you want out of life.", attached_image: "moon.png")
    Card.create!(name: "XIX - The Sun", description: "The Sun is always a joyful card to draw in a reading. It is a card of strength, inspiration, and positive energy. It is a message that you can do anything that you put your mind to, and that your positive energy will be returned to you. If you have been dealing with challenges and difficult times, this card is a sign that those times are over and you can expect things to get much brighter. You have come out of these challenging times stronger than ever and you can now enjoy life and go towards your goals with confidence.", reverse_description: "In reverse, the Sun is a message that you need to reconnect with your inner child and experience more joy in your life. As we get older, it’s harder to experience moments of pure joy and fun because we are so burdened with the responsibilities of life; we spend most of our time working, looking after our families, or doing chores. You may be feeling down because your everyday routines don’t allow for much time to simply sit back and enjoy life. Take this card as a sign that you should allow yourself more time off from your responsibilities and simply do something fun.", attached_image: "sun.png")
    Card.create!(name: "XX - Judgement", description: "Drawing Judgement in a reading suggests that you are going through, or will soon go through, a huge spiritual awakening. Your eyes and mind have been opened and you are more connected to your inner self than you ever have been before. Often, this card signifies that you are on the brink of huge change, and for this change to happen, you must make a life-altering decision. To make this choice, you must draw upon all of your knowledge and experience, and decide on the best path given all of the information you have available to you.", reverse_description: "In reverse, the Judgement card is a message that you need to take some time out of your life to reconnect with your inner self and practice some reflection. You have been running away from mistakes and feelings of regret and keeping them hidden for fear of others judging you too harshly. However, now is the time to clean your slate and start anew, and sometimes that means revealing the truth and taking full responsibility for your actions. Often this card is a sign from the universe that you need to make a big change, but you are simply ignoring those signs because you’re scared of what this change will mean for your life. It’s time to trust the universe and simply let go and see what happens; you will more than likely be pleasantly surprised.", attached_image: "judgement.png")
    Card.create!(name: "XXI - The World", description: "Drawing the World in a reading suggests that you are coming to the end of a phase of your life and are feeling very accomplished and proud of what you have achieved. You have worked hard, and you are now able to enjoy the fruits of your labour. This card often signifies a wedding or a birth, or sometimes a graduation and the end of a long period of education and growth. Now is the time to look back and reflect on your journey, and how far you have come. You should feel proud and grateful for all of the experiences you’ve had and the lessons you’ve learned. But also be prepared because with the end of one phase comes the beginning of another, so get ready to start again.", reverse_description: "In reverse, the World suggests that you are looking to mark a period of your life as close, but something is stopping you. There is an obstacle in your way that is preventing you from moving on and leaving the past behind, and you must figure out how to get past this and go forth. You may have recently ended a relationship and are finding it hard to let go of your ex-partner, or they are holding on to you. Or in order to flourish, you need to move away from a place you’ve called home but are too emotionally attached. Know that though leaving these things behind will be painful for a while, you will grow stronger from this pain and will eventually be happier for the change. If you are close to the completion of a project or are trying to reach a goal, don’t give up now. If you are struggling, look at things from a different angle and see how you can approach this a different way to guarantee success.", attached_image: "world.png")

    Card.create!(name: "Ace of Wands", description: "All of the Aces in the Tarot deck signify new beginnings, and the Ace of Wands indicates that this beginning is linked to work and enterprise. If you draw the Ace of Wands, it shows that you are about to embark on a new venture. Perhaps you have a new job, or you are going to start your own business. It is a sign that you should go for what you want, and your inspiration and creative energy will ensure that it will be a success. You have a lot of potentials, and it is time to reach out and make the most of it.", reverse_description: "If you draw the Ace of Wands in reverse, it could suggest that you are having difficulty making a decision about what you want out of your life. You want to make a change but are lacking the confidence or the motivation to do so. You may also feel powerless to do anything to change your situation. You should take a step back and focus on your true passions; what is it you want to do? When you know, make a step-by-step plan to make the dream a reality.", attached_image: "ace_of_wands.png") 
    Card.create!(name: "Two of Wands", description: "The Two of Wands uses the inspiration and ideas of the Ace of Wands, and turns them into a solid plan of action. If you draw this card, it suggests that you are busy making plans for the future, and making strong, positive decisions about your life. A partnership will lead to the success of projects, as the meeting of minds will enhance anything you work towards. This card is also tied to discovery, and is a sign that you should step out of your comfort zone; you will discover a wealth of new experiences and adventures.", reverse_description: "In reverse, the Two of Wands indicates a lack of planning will lead to a false start or possible failure. You know what you want but you’re scared to take the next steps, and this is hindering your chances of success. If you’re in a partnership, there may be a clash of personalities or ideals that is causing issues and getting in the way of progress. If you’re struggling to move forward, it’s time to make a plan of action, and simply take the first step.", attached_image: "two_of_wands.png") 
    Card.create!(name: "Three of Wands", description: "The Three of Wands is a lucky card, and indicates that things are going, or soon will go your way. Plans have been made and now it’s time for action. Projects you are working on are well underway and are progressing nicely, and it’s now time to expand your horizons and maximise on your potential. This could be through further study, travel, or new business ventures. This is a time for networking, and opening doors for yourself. Keep an open mind and don’t be scared to ask for help or support from others.", reverse_description: "In reverse, the Three of Wands indicates that a stubborn independence and refusal to accept help will lead to delays and failures. A lack of foresight or planning could cause you to stumble at obstacles you’re not prepared for, and this will hinder your progress, leading to frustration. Perhaps you were overconfident and cocky about what you could achieve. It’s time to examine where you are going wrong, and how you make changes to move forward in a positive direction. Break big challenges down into small, manageable chunks, and never be too proud to accept help when it’s offered.", attached_image: "three_of_wands.png") 
    Card.create!(name: "Four of Wands", description: "The Four of Wands is a very happy card, signifying celebration, happiness and prosperity. The number four symbolises stability in numerology, and this card indicates strong roots and a happy, harmonious home. This card also represents a celebration, and suggests now is a great time to get together with friends and family. This could be a marriage or a birth, or another special milestone. Now is your opportunity to spend some extended quality time with those you love.", reverse_description: "If you draw this card in reverse, it indicates that there is a lack of harmony in your home environment. This could be down to a breakdown in communication, or due to an external threat. You may be caught up in other people’s issues, such as a family quarrel or a lover’s tiff. This is perhaps causing you to question your own relationships, causing you to create issues that aren’t there. The reverse of stability means change, and you are likely going through a shit of circumstances, perhaps in the form of a new job or moving home. Though change is hard, keep in mind that this move is necessary for your future happiness", attached_image: "four_of_wands.png") 
    Card.create!(name: "Five of Wands", description: "Fives in the Tarot deck signify conflict and rivalry, and the Five of Wands is no different. This card indicates that you’re currently dealing with a conflict of some sort, and this it is potentially standing in the way of your goals. This could be a disagreement with a partner or colleague, or perhaps you’re working on a group project on which nobody can agree. This card can also sometimes point to a friendlier, more productive competition; perhaps you’re competing in a sport or are have a job interview for which many others have applied. This is a chance to prove yourself and your abilities. You may be dealing with new people from different backgrounds, so it’s important to keep an open mind and try to cooperate.", reverse_description: "In reverse, the Five of Wands suggests that you are avoiding conflict.

If you are struggling to see beyond your emotional entanglements in a situation, you can consult with this person and they will help you make the right choice.", reverse_description: "In reverse, the King of Swords can often represent an abuse of power. There may be somebody in your life who is taking advantage of their advanced intellect and your emotions to manipulate you for their own gain. Be wary of anybody in your life who is trying to influence you to make a big decision without giving you all of the facts, and simply telling you to trust them. This card can also symbolise somebody who is acting completely ruthless and taking the ‘rule with your head, not with your heart’ message a little too far, and making decisions that can hurt others. Be careful who you trust.", attached_image: "king_of_swords.png")
